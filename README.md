# EMIS-System

## To compile and run,
- ensure java 8 is installed
- ensure maven is installed
1. import the pom's dependencies
2. run the `package` lifecycle with maven
3. execute the `emis.jar` file that is created in target folder from the previous result
4. once the application is running, open `localhost` in the browser, (it will run on the default port)
- patient: `p1@gmail.com` (UID = 1001); receptionist: `r1@gmail.com`; nurse: `n1@gmail.com`; doctor: `d1@gmail.com` (UID=4002)
- all passwords are `password`, the UID is related to the account's number, when in doubt use `1003` as a UID

## if not compiling and just want to run,
- ensure java 8 is installed
1. download `emis.jar` from the repository
2. continue from `step 3.` of the previous list.
